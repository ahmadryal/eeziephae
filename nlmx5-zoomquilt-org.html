Sandbo. https://neave.com/swarm/ - Swarming thing that follow your mouse https://neave.tv/ - TV with 'no context' (Click / Change channel) - Forever zooming pictures https://neave.com/imagination/ - Probably posted before https://danryckert.eu/ - Crazy and Weird -puzzlegame- https://neave.com/pixel-dust/ - Paint with pixels / Nothing special https://strobe.cool/ - Intesify your already hallucinogenic mind with some more illusions I'm sure some of these links have been posted. I'm looking for Baked Artist to create a project like this! ( It would be awesome! Slightly less dark, but still inspired by your favorite herb! Just draw whatever the Ganja is suggesting, just keep the center empty so we can nest something else inside! The new image could be nested in a blank painting, a blank window, a blank tv screen whatever! You draw, I'll take care of the editing :) Can't wait to see your ENTries! EDIT: Forgot to say: -Better colored. -We shoul. I've yet to have a proper, long trip before. I've only used salvia, cannabis and HBWR (but they failed). I got some 25i (not as good as L, I know) and I want the first trip to be something not overwhelming but definitely not boring. I was going to split a 1200ug tab so theoretically ~600ug. I want a list of websites which I can enjoy whilst I'm tripping. So far I have: http://new.weavesilk.com/. These are just a few websites I thoroughly enjoy while high.

Despite modern neural networks have more in common with algebra then biology, we cannot ignore the similarities with the way real neurons work. Findings in machine learning and mathematics have already been useful to understand how the brain works. For instance, certain dopaminergic neurons have been shown to implement, de-fact, a reinforcement learning protocol in which dopamin corresponds to the "expected reward" of an event. Without such a deep knowledge of machine learning, it would • Excellent: Zoom quilt I: • Great with added audio: Infinite Oz • Good: Zoom quilt II http://zoomquilt2.madmindworx.com/zoomquilt2.swf. Mixed 1p-LSD and poppers after only 1 week tolerance, and my god visuals were far stronger than a 4tab trip with the same tolerance. It's more legal, cheaper?, easier to obtain, and arguably as potent as the revered Molly/LSD combo. visuals were similar to the following (http://zoomquilt.org). I made a post a couple months back of a large array of websites to enjoy while high. Here is a new updated list for all you fellow ents to enjoy: --Also feel free to add me on steam id : intensifrying : will accept any friend requests-- --more sites will be added if suggested or i find more-- : this site is an online drawing board.

Here's an updated List of sites For you fellow Ents: First of all, flockdraw. An online drawing room for you guys. Multiple drawing rooms for if they get full:. Looking for opinions on which of the following videos you prefer and why. Not asking you to critique the song, so if you don't like the music just press mute. The song is the same for both videos. This is a self post so remember no karma for me, just upvotes for visability. Also, both videos are unlisted and I will be posting the "final" one separately, so I don't care about view counts and I don't have AdSense enabled for these videos. I seriously am just looking for your opinions/prefe. http://zoomquilt.org/index.html. Point me in the right direction. ( Zoom through an adventure. ( Space version of the previous link.
